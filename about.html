    <h1>AwakenHuman: About Us</h1>

    <h2>🌍 Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      AwakenHuman is a global movement to ignite human consciousness, spread scientific thinking, and unite people beyond boundaries of belief, nation, or language.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 What We Believe</h2>
    <p>
      We believe in the power of the human mind, the necessity of truth, and the potential of compassion to transform the world. In an age of noise, fear, and division, we choose awareness, knowledge, and solidarity.
    </p>

    <h2>🌱 Why We Exist</h2>
    <p>
      Millions still live under outdated ideologies, harmful dogmas, and manipulated narratives. Our goal is to build an open-source platform where reason leads, education liberates, and shared humanity thrives.
    </p>

    <h2>🤝 How You Can Join</h2>
    <p>
      We welcome thinkers, creators, skeptics, believers in peace, educators, developers, and dreamers. Whether you contribute ideas, share our message, donate, or simply think deeply—you're part of this awakening.
    </p>

    <p><em>“Let us awaken not just as individuals, but as one humanity—curious, compassionate, and consciously evolving.”</em></p>
